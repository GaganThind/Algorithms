# Algorithms

Selection Sort -> Every iteration, take the minimum element and put it in position. O(n2) -> n square

Bubble Sort -> It works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in wrong order. O(n*n)

Insertion sort -> Like sorting playing cards. Iterate from arr[1] to arr[n] over the array. Compare the current element (key) to its predecessor. If the key element is
smaller than its predecessor, compare it to the elements before. Move the greater elements one position up to make space for the swapped element. O(n*2)

Merge Sort -> Divide and Conquer algorithm. It divides input array in two halves, calls itself for the two halves and then merges the two sorted halves. O(nLogn).

QuickSort -> Divide and Conquer algorithm. It picks an element as pivot and partitions the given array around the picked pivot.

Heap sort -> Comparison based sorting technique based on Binary Heap data structure. It is similar to selection sort where we first find the maximum element and place the maximum element at the end. We repeat the same process for the remaining elements.
